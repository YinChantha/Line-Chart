# Line-Chart
This is my private project using an API call to show different banks in Cambodia with a history of Line charts. Users can compare banks with this line chart as well.

  *Currently the deployment link I put has some problems so you can clone this project by:
		
      - git clone https://github.com/YinChantha/Line-Chart.git
      - cd <your project>
      - npm install
      - npm run dev

 Then you can test and play around with our project (Noted: That is real data in all banks in Cambodia)
